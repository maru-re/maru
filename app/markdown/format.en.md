# Import Data Format Description

## For Users

Nijūmaru lyrics files use the `.maru` extension. You can import them into the app by dragging and dropping or using a share link. ZIP archives containing lyrics files are also supported.

You can use the [built-in lyrics editor](/create) to create or edit lyrics. The editor is currently only supported on desktop computers.

You can also join our [Discord server](https://chat.maru.re) to discuss and share experiences in creating lyrics with others.

## For Developers

Lyrics files use the YAML format. Here's an example:

```yaml
# Schema version, currently has to be v1
schema: v1
# The YouTube video ID of the song, also used as the song ID in the app
youtube: SX_ViT4Ra7k
# The title of the song

# The artists of the song, a string list
artists:
  - 米津玄師
# The tags for categorizing the song, a string list

# Date when the lyrics was last updated

# The lyrics of the song, in LRC format. A multi-line string

The LRC part supports some extended features, such as using `{}()` to mark furigana, `<00:00.00>` for inline timestamps, and `[trans:locale]` to mark translations.

For detailed field descriptions, please refer to the TypeScript definition file. You can also get type hints and data structure validation by installing the npm package `npm i @marure/schema`.
