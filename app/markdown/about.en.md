# About maru.re

<ruby font-jp-serif><rb>二重丸</rb><rt>にじゅうまる</rt></ruby> (maru.re) was established to continue the high-quality Japanese learning platform provided by jpmarumaru.com.
In August 2024, jpmarumaru.com unexpectedly shut down without any prior notice. Since the site had no public mirror or backup, many features lacked suitable alternatives in the market. Thus, Nijūmaru was born.

Nijūmaru is a YouTube-based song lyrics reader without built-in lyrics. Users need to import supported format files themselves; imported files will be cached on local devices. The app only provides display and interactive capabilities.
The app is completely free and <a href="https://github.com/maru-re/maru" target="_blank">open-source</a>, hoping to gather everyone's efforts to improve it together, help more students who want to learn Japanese, and provide a better Japanese learning environment.
