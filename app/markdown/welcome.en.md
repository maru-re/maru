# Welcome to Nijumaru

<ruby font-jp-serif><rb>二重丸</rb><rt>にじゅうまる</rt></ruby> is a YouTube-based song lyrics reader and player, primarily designed for learning Japanese lyrics.

The player **does not have built-in lyrics**. You need to import files in supported formats or open them through shared links. We also provide a built-in lyrics editor for easy creation and sharing of lyrics.

We invite you to join our [Discord server](https://chat.maru.re) to discuss and share with us, let's make this App even better.

We hope you enjoy and wish you success in your Japanese learning journey!
