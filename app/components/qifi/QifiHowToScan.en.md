Due to the transfer size limitation of a single QR Code, we use a <b>dynamic QR Code</b> called {QiFi}.

After scanning with a camera app, it will direct you to the QRS scanner page to continue scanning the remaining information. You may need camera permissions during this process; rest assured, the webpage code is open source and does not save camera footage. Once data reception is complete, it will automatically return to maru to open the corresponding song.

Some camera apps may not scan dynamic QR codes properly. You can click <span rounded bg-gray:20 p1 inline-flex align-middle><span i-uil-pause-circle /></span> to pause, which might help you scan.

You can also manually enter the scanning webpage address: [qrss.netlify.app](https://qrss.netlify.app)
